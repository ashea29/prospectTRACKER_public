# prospectTRACKER_public
### A job search tracker web app.
Refactor-in-progress of https://github.com/ashea29/job-tracker, which was the second of four projects during my software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly and was completed initially around the beginning of 2020. 

This refactor (almost a complete overhaul of the original code) is being built with React via Webpack and Babel (no CRA), Redux, TypeScript, authentication, the Google Maps API and a Firebase backend.
